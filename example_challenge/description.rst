==========================================

A function that takes two numbers as postional arguments and adds them together, returning the result.

The function will take two numbers (integers or floats), and return the two numbers added together, with the
following reservations :

 - If either value is zero the result returned should be zero
 - If either value is negative the result should be zero

There is no requirement for the function to test the type of either argument.
