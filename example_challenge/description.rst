The following is a fully set of test data for a the 'example_challenge'. The description is ::

    A function that takes two numbers as postional arguments and adds them together, returning the result.

    The function will take two numbers (integers or floats), and return the two numbers added together, with the
    following reservations :

     - If either value is zero the result returned should be zero
     - If either value is negative the result should be zero
     - If both values are negative the function should raise a ValueError exception.

    There is no requirement for the function to test the type of either argument.

    Exceptions
    ----------

    The Function is required to raise a ValueError exception when both arguments are negative.
